/**
 * This is a reducer - a function that takes a current state value and an
 * action object describing "what happened", and returns a new state value.
 * A reducer's function signature is: (state, action) => newState
 *
 * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.
 * The root state value is usually an object.  It's important that you should
 * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
 *
 * You can use any conditional logic you want in a reducer. In this example,
 * we use a switch statement, but it's not required.
