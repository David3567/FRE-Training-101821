# Remarks

To judge if it's a bullet-proof responsive design,
not really, I can make a better job, but to be honest I've set
a limit on how much time I want to spend - messing around with
vanilla CSS, if I use any kind of library as I always do.
Such things come right of the box.

## For the future exercises I can implement such a design system, if we are to mess with vanilla CSS

### Definitely it can be fun to do, as you think through all the wrappers and media queries you ll implement
